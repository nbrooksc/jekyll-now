Hi. I was born in Indianapolis, currently living in Chicagoland. I took a few programming classes (C, C++, HTML) in high school. I came back to it as an adult, first in an attempt to automate SEO articles. Eventually I started making apps for IoT startups, and over time my role expanded. I've usually worked with small teams, and that's allowed me to learn a little about a lot. In a small team you have to do the thing that needs to get done, even if it's not explicitly in your wheelhouse.

Outside of programming I like to run half marathons, I'm addicted to sports, I'm a recovering news junkie. Anymore reading the news just makes me mad. Our ability to get angry about things outstrips our ability to actually do anything productive with our anger. 

General Competencies - PHP, Java, Javascript, Node.js, MySQL, iOS, Android, Express
